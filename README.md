How to use git

clone a repository that you created on git

    git clone https://path.to.repo.copied.from.git

all of these commands require you to be in a git project folder:

see details of what's changed locally

    git status

add new files to git or remove deleted ones

    git add -A

commit changes locally

    git commit -am "write a small note of your changes here"

push changes to server so other people can see (or you on other machine)

    git push

pull changes from server

    git pull
